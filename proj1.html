			<h1><br>Early Detection of Forest Fires</h1>
			<h3><br>The purpose of this product was to design and develop a prototype of a
			forest fire detection unit. Each unit is trained to detect fire and smoke with
			the use of machine learning, and then confirmed using an algorithm that uses
			additional sensors for verification purposes. The units are equipped with a
			camera, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, particulate sensor, and data 
			transceiver to allow for communication between the units to a central location. </h3>
			<h3><br>The prototype was able to successfully detect fire and smoke at short distances
			using machine learning, while running the algorithm to check this output with 
			that of the sensors. We were only able to get one unit to send out data 
			and one unit to receive data.</h3>
