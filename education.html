			<h1>Portland State University</h1>
			<h3>I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus in Analog circuit design, 
			which encompasses the use of radio frequencies used to design and create a circuit. Much of my work entailed 
			designing, simulating, building, and testing circuits. Some applications include: an audio amplifier,
			transmission line quadrature hybrid coupler, and phase lock loop. Although I do enjoy working with 
			Analog and RF circuits, I have developed a strong interest in programming, especially for web and 
			app development. In addition to C and python I have learned in my time in school, I have taught myself
			the basics of HTML, CSS, and Swift Programming languages as well as a basic understanding of navigating
			through the Xcode IDE.</h3>

			<h3>Right out of high school, I attended community college to take pre-requisite courses while working part-time
			to save up money for University and ensure I am following my ideal career path.</h3>
